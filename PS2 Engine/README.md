# PS2 Engine
Scripts for PS2 Engine titles

**yakuza_OME** - Noesis plugin for PS2 OME model format. Supports skeletons and weights, but weights might be a little odd, so I recommend smoothing them.

**authman** - Extract and repack files from PS2 Auth files (.dat only). This was made for the purpose of extracting models and textures from cutscenes.

**model_sorting** - Various scripts I had for sorting models, from 2021. I don't really remember what they did, but I put it here anyways.
