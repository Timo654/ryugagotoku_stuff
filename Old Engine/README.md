# Old Engine
Scripts for Old Engine titles

**musashi_shopping** - Script for editing shop.bin files in Ryu ga Gotoku KENZAN! and Yakuza 3.

**name_extractor** - Extracts names from chara_common/name_list.bin used in Old Engine titles. Does not support repacking.

**Y3_info** - Extracts and repacks Yakuza 3 chara_common/info.bin. Not tested on other titles, will most definitely not work with Y5 and newer.

**disposeTool** - Tool for editing dispose_string.bin. Only tested with Ishin, but should work with other titles too.
